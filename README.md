Here is a port of CPU86, the Free VHDL CPU8088 IP core.

The original website is :
- http://ht-lab.com/cpu86.htm

Original Readme is [here](readme.txt)

Original platform/implementation was :
- [Enterpoint Drigmorn1 board](https://www.enterpoint.co.uk/shop/home/17-drigmorn1.html), Xilinx ISE 12.1 

I have ported the project to newer :
- [GadgetFactory Papilio](http://store.gadgetfactory.net/papilio-one-500k-spartan-3e-fpga-dev-board/), Xilinx ISE 14.7 (last one supporting old FPGAS)
- [Arrow Max1000 FPGA](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/max1000/arrow-development-tools), Intel Quartus Prime 17.1

Basic usage instructions coming soon..

In the mean time there is a short wiki [here](https://github.com/nsauzede/cpu86/wiki)

Stay tuned and/or Have fun !
