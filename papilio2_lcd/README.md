# Papilio2 LCD

This project builds upon work in the Drigmorn1 project and does the following:

* Uses Papilio Duo
* Uses LCD wing for Sharp LCD screens (3x6 bits colors)
* Instantiates Open source 808x processor and a rudimentary VGA-like controller
* The integrated MON88 monitor allows to alter the memory, such as the video memory
* Currently, all text is white, but any of the 4096 available colors could be used.
